A steps-based calories counter is a simple and practical way to estimate energy expenditure from daily walking or running. On average, 2,000 steps burn about 100 calories, which means one step burns roughly 0.05 calories. Many fitness trackers simplify this further by using a fixed ratio, such as 500 steps burning 20 calories. While the actual calories burned depend on weight, speed, and terrain, this method provides an easy approximation that helps people monitor their activity levels, set goals like 10,000 steps per day, and stay motivated toward maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

2.Analyze =
The idea is to create an application or device that calculates the number of calories a person burns based on the number of steps they walk or run. This works by using a mathematical formula that considers the step count along with the user's personal details like weight. The more steps a person takes, the more energy they use, which translates to burned calories. To make this accurate, the system must be calibrated using reliable data and formulas from health research. It must be user-friendly, allowing easy input of personal data, and provide clear, motivating results. This technology will help people track their fitness progress, manage their weight, and maintain a healthy lifestyle by giving them a direct insight into their daily activity levels.


3.Ideate=
1. Problem Statement
   People who exercise often want to know how effective their workouts are. Simply counting steps doesn't show the full picture of energy burned. There is a need for a simple tool that converts step count into an estimate of calories burned, personalized to the user's body weight, to provide meaningful feedback and motivation for their fitness journey.


2. Algorithm:
 Step 1. Start

Step 2. Input User's Weight (in kg) and Step Count.

Step 3. Calculate Calories Burned using formula: Calories = Steps × Weight × 0.0004

Step 4. Display calculated Calories.

Step 5. Check step count and provide ranking:

· If steps ≥ 10000: "Excellent"
· Else if steps ≥ 7000: "Very Good"
· Else if steps ≥ 5000: "Good"
· Else if steps ≥ 3000: "Average"
· Else: "Need to Improve"







4.Testing=

1. Test Case 1: If steps = 12000, weight = 70 kg
   · Calories = 12000 * 70 * 0.0004 = 336 kcal
   · Ranking: "Excellent! Keep up the great work!"
2. Test Case 2: If steps = 8000, weight = 65 kg
   · Calories = 8000 * 65 * 0.0004 = 208 kcal
   · Ranking: "Very Good! You're doing well!"
3. Test Case 3: If steps = 6000, weight = 60 kg
   · Calories = 6000 * 60 * 0.0004 = 144 kcal
   · Ranking: "Good! Try to reach 7000 steps tomorrow."
4. Test Case 4: If steps = 4000, weight = 75 kg
   · Calories = 4000 * 75 * 0.0004 = 120 kcal
   · Ranking: "Average. You need to improve your activity."
5. Test Case 5: If steps = 1000, weight = 80 kg
   · Calories = 1000 * 80 * 0.0004 = 32 kcal
   · Ranking: "Need to improve significantly. Aim for at least 5000 steps daily."
